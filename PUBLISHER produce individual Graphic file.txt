'The doc and datasource must already been merged or published
'If you get an error on line  'TotalPages = .DataSource.RecordCount', the solution is to connect to the datasource which is the step 3 (Create recipient list). UPDATE Have inserted
' codes to check if datasource is connected
'The location of Publisher publication file is where the output are to be written.
'TIPS:  If you get this error                             Solution
'       Hard disk is full                          Save the new publication. Close Publisher. Open the new publication, don't need to open the originating document
